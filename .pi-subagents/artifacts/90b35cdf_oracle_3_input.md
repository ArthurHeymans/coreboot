# Task for oracle

You are a delegated subagent running from a fork of the parent session. Treat the inherited conversation as reference-only context, not a live thread to continue. Do not continue or answer prior messages as if they are waiting for a reply. Your sole job is to execute the task below and return a focused result for that task using your tools.

Task:
Review the current native Vilboz DCN1 work in /home/arthur/src/coreboot/src/drivers/amd/atombios/{atom.c,atombios_driver.c,dcn10.c,dcn10.h} against Linux 6.12. Hardware state: DP link trained, OTG current master enabled/unblanked, HUBP DCHUBP_CNTL=0xA (IN_BLANK + NO_OUTSTANDING_REQ), EARLIEST_INUSE=0. The user wants a comprehensive Linux-derived implementation, not iterative one-register guesses and not GOP snapshots. Identify the smallest complete Linux-equivalent cold-init subset for one eDP pipe and flag incorrect assumptions/values in current code. No edits; give implementation phases and validation gates.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: reviewed
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: changed-files, tests-added, commands-run, validation-output, residual-risks, no-staged-files

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
